    "## Motivation Behind Exploration of This Dataset and Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did we choose this dataset over others? \n",
    "\n",
    "- We chose this dataset because with COVID-19 restrictions slowly but surely relaxing, the privilege of being able to travel is now something we can resume doing. \n",
    "- Whether a trip to New York City be for business or vacation, the city sees millions of visitors per year being one of the biggest cities of the world with so much to offer and everyone visiting over a few days needs somewhere to stay\n",
    "- By providing a data analysis into the listing market of AirBnB properties, we can make an impact on where people may stay to best suits their needs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Was there any other dataset we found interesting as well? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Other datasets focused on data pertaining to the world development rankings of nations around the world as well as datasets surrounding information about different airlines also peaked our interests as we focus on travel reopening up with COVID-19 restrictions relaxing\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can be found here \n",
    "    1. https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction\n",
    "    2. https://www.kaggle.com/undp/human-development\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Potential Research Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. On average do hosts tend to own property in a particular area of the city or do hosts with multiple listings spread their assets across the city?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which neighborhoods communities have the highest propensity to host visitors (based on available listed AirBnB properties within community), which do not? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the type of room of the average listed property within each of the boroughs change? (Which boroughs have more entire homes for a family available) \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Does a properties distance from the city centre (downtown Manhattan) have an impact on the daily price rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Where are the highest density of listed properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using pandas to read in, clean and preform an exploratory data analysis of the dataset to gather statistical insights \n",
    "- we will also use matplotlib and seaborn to display the data, and create visual representations of the data that the user can then view the data. \n",
    "- this will include, scatterplots, bar charts, heatmaps to show correlation between different attributes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Potential \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visitors spend an unbelievable amount of time searching for appropriate accommodations, by doing a deep look into the different types of listed properties offered on the NYC AirBnB market, there can be a massive push for applications to be put in place to figure out the best possible options for people of all walks of life coming to NYC for various reasons under different circumstances - all in all contributing to people's stays within NYC. We can create accurate prediction models to best suit the needs of different individuals\n",
